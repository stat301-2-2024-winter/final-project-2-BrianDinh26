# Introduction {#sec-introduction}
For this project, I used a dataset^[Kirill Lepchenkov's Used Cars Dataset ([see website](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lepchenkov/usedcarscatalog/data))] on online used car sales, which described the characteristics of various car listings on the website in factor, logical, and numerical form.

In this predictive model building project, I was motivated to learn more about what variables affect the price of a car being resold and what models were the best for creating price predictions. This sort of model would be useful in figuring out if a person is overvaluing or undervaluing their car price listing relative to the market, or if a buyer is getting a good deal or not online.
