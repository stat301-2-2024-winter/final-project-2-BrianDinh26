## Overview

This folder contains RDA files of figures for the final project.

## RDA Files
- `assess_final.rda`: Contains assessment figures of final model, including graphs of predicted vs actual price values in log and original scales and a table of metrics for the final model.
- `best_hyperparameters_1.rda`: Contains tables showing the best values for tuned hyperparameters for the elastic net, knn, boosted tree, and random forest models using the kitchen sink recipe.
- `best_hyperparameters_2.rda`: Contains tables showing the best values for tuned hyperparameters for the elastic net, knn, boosted tree, and random forest models using the feature engineered recipe.
- `bt_autoplot.rda`: Plot of best hyperparameters for the boosted tree model in a graph.
- `data_exploration`: Plots of categorical and numerical vavriable distributions and relationships.
- `missingness_check`: Graph displaying level of missingness for each variable in the dataset.
- `pm_2_table`: Contains table comparing RMSEs between the baseline null model and ordinary linear regression model using the baseline, kitchen sink recipe.
- `rmse_tables`: Contains tables comparing RMSEs between null model, ordinary linear regression model, elastic net model, k-nearest neighbors model, random forest model, and boosted tree model for the kitchen sink recipe, the feature engineered recipe, and both recipes combined, for a total of 3 tables.
